## The following are re-readings of the Ten Commandments, not to define sin as something to avoid, but to define the good which all should seek in the world.

1. Be loyal in everything you do, especially to God who is the greatest of Great.
2. Use words which reflect well on yourself, your family, your community, and God.
3. Take time to rest and shut out secular distractions, so as you return you can focus on your work.
4. Respect those with authority over you, to the end that you can only be in a position of authority yourself if others take your responsibility with respect.
5. Value the dignity of all human life.
6. A primary aim in life is to take another's hand in marriage.  Do not let anyone come between this union.
7. Property is a right bestowed by God, respect and defend your property and that of others.
8. Tell the truth in all cases regarding yourself and others, it is destructive to deal in deceit and falsehoods.
9. Celebrate your neighbor's domain and help him expand and maintain it.
10. Be content with what you have and remember the work that went in to procuring it.
