## Principles

The principles on which the church is founded are to be placed here.  Each principle shall be enumerated in a separate document with a thorough definition, some discussion of the reasoning for the principle, and some guidance on the application thereof.  Effort should be made to keep these principles to a minimum and the wording precise and concise.  Where possible, falling back to general Christian principles should be preferred to redefinition and exposition in the context of this new church.

Another goal of these principles is to keep them all positive and pragmatic.  A principle that warns followers what not to do may help them recognize what is bad, but a principle that shows them what to do will necessarily bring them to what is good.  As Alexis de Toqueville said in his masterpiece "Democracy in America",

> America is great because she is good. If America ceases to be good, America will cease to be great. 1

So we should strive for the good, and our principles should guide us in this direction.  These principles should also be pragmatic; we live in a world where faith is failing, thus a principle that will appeal to the more secular minded will have a better shot of being accepted by more of those who would otherwise be non-believers.
