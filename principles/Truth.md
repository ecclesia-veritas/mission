## Truth

Truth is speaking what you know to be correct or intentionally omitting information you know to be necessary to a statement to be complete.  Truth ends in speech, but begins in thought.  Maintaining internally thoughts which are true follows with speech that is true.

In boolean logic, that discipline followed by computer scientists, a string of true values can be destroyed by just one which is false.  In code it would be described as:

```
true && true && ... && true && false  # false
```

So it can be shown that what is perhaps a short term convenience of uttering a falsehood leads to a long term degradation of integrity and should therefore be avoided to the greatest extent possible.
