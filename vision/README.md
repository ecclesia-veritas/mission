## Vision

Documents in this directory are meant to lay out a vision for the church as clearly laid out as possible.  The vision includes jurisdiction of the church's authority, how it relates to other institutions in peoples' lives, and areas for the church to expand in a positive direction.  As the vision changes, documents should be updated to remain up-to-date.  The documents should also be removed or marked as deprecated if they are no longer a part of the vision of the church.
